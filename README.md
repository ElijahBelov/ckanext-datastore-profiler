**What is this?**
This is a public repo for logic and documentation for Toronto's Open Data Profiler

**What is the Open Data Profiler**
Eventually, it will
1. Summarize each attribute in Toronto Open Data datastore resources
2. Assign classifications to each attribute
3. Present those on the Portal's API (and maybe frontend)
